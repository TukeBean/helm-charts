<p>This check finds Pods that request more than 6 CPU.</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Why is this a problem?</dt>
  <dd>
    aPod VM(s) all have 10 CPU in total. Pods that request more than 6 CPU will have
    difficulties getting scheduled due to the number of DaemonSet (logging, monitoring,
    etc.) already running on all nodes.
  </dd>
  <dt>How to fix?</dt>
  <dd>
    Consider scaling by number of Pods (don't use a single Pod). You can also consider
    deploying to other clusters (i.e Scaleout) instead of Baremetal control plane.
