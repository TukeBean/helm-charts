<p>This check finds containers that do not have CPU and memory limits configured.</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Why is this a problem?</dt>
  <dd>
    Such containers could use an unbounded amount of resources (for example, because of a
    memory leak). Those resources would then not be available to other (potentially more
    important) containers running on the same node. We have already had API outages
    because of this.
  </dd>
  <dt>How to fix?</dt>
  <dd>
    Configure requests and limits for &quot;cpu&quot; and &quot;memory&quot; as described in
    <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/">this article</a>.
    Choose values based on historical usage, by looking at the <code>container_cpu_usage_seconds_total</code> and
    <code>container_memory_working_set_bytes</code> metrics in prometheus-kubernetes. The Grafana dashboard
    <a href="https://grafana.eu-de-1.cloud.sap/d/kubernetes-container-resources/kubernetes-container-resources">Container Resources</a>
    shows these metrics in the &quot;CPU Usage&quot; and &quot;Memory Usage&quot; panels. <strong>Set
    the memory request equal to the memory limit to avoid unexpected scheduling behavior.</strong> For CPU, request
    and limit can and should diverge: The request represents the baseline load, the limit encompasses all expected
    spikes.
