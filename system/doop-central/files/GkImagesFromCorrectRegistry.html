<p>This check finds containers that do not pull their images from Keppel in the correct region.</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Why is this a problem?</dt>
  <dd>
    By pulling your images from the same region as your Pod deployment, you benefit from
    higher download bandwidth and lower latencies compared to pulling from a different
    region. This is especially true for big images.

  <dt>How to fix?</dt>
  <dd>
    Replace your current registry with the appropriate regional registry value as defined in
    <code>$REGION/values/globals.yaml</code> file from cc/secrets repo.
    <br><br>
    Instead of manually specifying the regional registry value, it is recommended to amend
    your deployment process to include the <code>globals.yaml</code> file in your
    <code>helm upgrade</code> invocation, then you can reference the specific value
    directly in your Helm chart
