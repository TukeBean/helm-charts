<p>This check finds references to several deprecated API versions in Helm manifests.</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Why is this a problem?</dt>
  <dd>We cannot upgrade to Kubernetes 1.16 or newer before all such references are removed.</dd>
  <dt>How to fix?</dt>
  <dd>
    In your Helm chart templates, replace the deprecated API versions with their newer
    counterparts (refer to the <a
      href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-guide/#v1-16">v1.16</a>
    and <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-guide/#v1-22">v1.22</a>
    deprecation docs). After this change, <code>helm diff upgrade</code> will show a diff
    that deletes the object with the old API version and recreates it with the new API
    version, but <code>helm upgrade</code> will understand that we're still talking about
    the same object and not touch it. But regardless, it's recommended to perform the API
    version change when you do not have any other diffs in your pipeline, because those
    other diffs might be obscured by this fake diff.
    <br><br>
    Note: some clusters are still using k8s v1.15.9 and you might need to add an extra
    check (e.g. <code>{{- if .Capabilities.APIVersions.Has $newer-api-version }}</code>)
    in your helm template in order to stay backwards-compatible.

  <dt>There is a violation report for a Helm 2 release, but we have already migrated to Helm 3. What's going on?</dt>
  <dd>
    You probably forgot to cleanup your Helm 2 releases after migrating to Helm 3.
    Double-check with <code>helm3 ls</code> that you are really deploying with Helm 3,
    then cleanup the old Helm 2 releases manually. You can find them with:
    <pre><code>kubectl get configmaps -n kube-system -l OWNER=TILLER | grep $RELEASE_NAME</code></pre>
