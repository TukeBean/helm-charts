<p>This check finds Helm releases that do not define owner info.</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Why is this a problem?</dt>
  <dd>
    Owner info such as maintainer's name tells other operators who is responsible for a
    specific release.
  </dd>
  <dt>How to fix?</dt>
  <dd>
    Add owner-info chart as a dependency to your Helm chart and add the necessary
    configuration parameters to your chart's <code>Values.yaml</code> file
	(<a href="https://github.com/sapcc/helm-charts/tree/master/common/owner-info">instructions</a>).
    The owner-chart will then deploy a ConfigMap that has all the necessary owner info in the format
    that this policy expects.
