  <dt>Where to find vulnerability reports?</dt>
  <dd>
    Copy-paste the path part of the image (e.g.
    &quot;keppel.eu-de-1.cloud.sap/ccloud/limes&quot;) into your browser address bar. This
    opens the image list for that repo in Elektra's Keppel UI. Find the relevant image
    (look for a vulnerability status other than &quot;Clean&quot;) and open its details
    view to find the vulnerabilities, down near the image layers where they were
    introduced.
