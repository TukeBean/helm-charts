<p>This check finds Helm 2 releases.</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Why is this a problem?</dt>
  <dd>
    Helm 2 does not support Kubernetes 1.17 or newer. We have to migrate all Helm 2
    releases to Helm 3 before upgrading.

  <dt>How to migrate from Helm 2 to Helm 3?</dt>
  <dd>There is a detailed presentation in SharePoint in the folder for the July 2020 Demo Day.</dd>
  <dt>My release is listed here, but we have already migrated to Helm 3. What's going on?</dt>
  <dd>
    You probably forgot to cleanup your Helm 2 releases after migrating to Helm 3.
    Double-check with <code>helm3 ls</code> that you are really deploying with Helm 3,
    then cleanup the old Helm 2 releases manually. You can find them with:
    <pre><code>kubectl get configmaps -n kube-system -l OWNER=TILLER | grep $RELEASE_NAME</code></pre>
  </dd>
